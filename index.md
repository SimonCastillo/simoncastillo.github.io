## Own life history evolution
<p align="justify">
Endemic from <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcyXbcsTLtU">Santiago</a>, Chile. I've spent almost my whole life in Santiago. I studied Biology at the <a href = "http://biologia.uc.cl/es/">School of  Biological Sciences</a> <a href= "http://www.uc.cl/"> @Pontifical Catholic University of Chile</a> between 2009-2013. During that time, I worked doing traditional experimental eco-physiology <a href ="http://labecofisiouc.wixsite.com/ecofisio"> @Pancho Bozinovic's Lab</a>, and also volunteering as field technician during the summers in Southern Chile monitoring terrestrial carnivores populations. The last year of my undergrad, I went to Navarno Island for a year, I worked <a href = "http://www.labwankara.com/">@Wankara Lab</a> monitoring freshwater insect populations as indicators of Global Warming and also, monitoring the introduced population of the American mink (<i>Neovison vison</i>) in Patagonia.

## Current interests
<p align="justify">
In March, 2016, I got back to the 'civilization', starting a PhD @ Catholic University, under the supervision of <a href = "http://biologia.uc.cl/es/cuerpo-academico/profesor/45"> Pablo Marquet</a> and <a href = "http://biologia.uc.cl/es/cuerpo-academico/profesor/40">Juan Keymer</a>, I started my PhD project aiming to understand the ecology of an invasive strategy, such as cancer, within the human ecosystem.<br>
  Other approaches that I do to get closer of natural manifestations is though photography, I enjoy trekking and nature wildlife photographs (I have a bias to animals above plants or landscapes) and also I love to mix some sounds, producing something of Experimental music.<br>
  Also, a bit closer to electronic stuffs, I'm just discovering DIY technologies, so I'll try to post my advances here, of course I belive in open access, then use/share/edit as you'd like all u find here.
