## Life history evolution

Endemic from <a href "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcyXbcsTLtU">Santiago</a>, Chile. I've spent almost my whole life in Santiago. I studied Biology at the School of <a href = "http://biologia.uc.cl/es/"> Biological Sciences</a> @ <a href= "http://www.uc.cl/"> Pontifical Catholic University of Chile</a> between 2009-2013. During that time, I worked doing traditional experimental eco-physiology @ <a href ="http://labecofisiouc.wixsite.com/ecofisio"> Pancho Bozinovic's Lab</a>, and also volunteering as field technician during the summers in Southern Chile monitoring terrestrial carnivores populations. The last year of my undergrad, I went to Navarno Island for a year, I worked <a href = "http://www.labwankara.com/">@Wankara Lab</a> monitoring freshwater insect populaitons as indicators of Global Warming and also, monitoring the introduced population of the American mink (Neovison vison) in Patagonia. 

## Current interests
In March, 2016, I got back to the 'civilization', starting a PhD @ Catholic University, under the supervision of <a href = "http://biologia.uc.cl/es/cuerpo-academico/profesor/45"> Pablo Marquet<a> and <a href = "http://biologia.uc.cl/es/cuerpo-academico/profesor/40">Juan Keymer<a>, I started my PhD project aiming to understand the ecology of an invasive strategy, such as cancer, within the human ecosystem.
